Created function which asks user for Pokemon name, which then pulls the relevant data for user's view.

## Note for grading instructor

In case you're, like me, not too familiar with Pokemon names, here is a sample list of some Pokemon names for your reference when testing my code:

* Snorlax
* Pikachu
* Squirtle
* Charmander
* Bulbasaur
