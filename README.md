# Pokemon API HW

Created function which asks user for Pokemon name, which then pulls the relevant data for user's view.

## Note for grading instructor

In case you're, like me, not too familiar with Pokemon names, here is a sample list of some Pokemon names for your reference when testing my code:

* Snorlax
* Pikachu
* Squirtle
* Charmander
* Bulbasaur

## Additional note for grading instructor.

The newly posted optional assignment page now instructs us to make *twenty* Pokemons, rather than the initial 5. I included a few Pokemon suggestions above, but the code is able to pull any Pokemon's information (as long as they're part of the API). I also edited my initial version with the new additions to the instructions (type, weight). I also tried to make the UI display the info as cleanly and readably as possible. I hope you like it!
